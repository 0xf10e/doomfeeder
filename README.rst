==========
Get items from the RSS feed of `The Doom that Came to Puppet`_
and print them in a way suitable to feed into the Phosphor 
screensaver from the `XScreenSaver distribution`_::

    ~$ git clone https://github.com/0xf10e/doomfeeder.git \
        /tmp/doomfeeder
    Cloning into '/tmp/doomfeeder'...
    [...]
    ~$ /usr/libexec/xscreensaver/phosphor -program \
        '/tmp/doomfeeder/doomfeeder.go' -delay 80000
